        </header>

        <p>My name is Ben Chan. From a young age, I've been interested in technology. After graduating high school, I
            went to
            college for electrical engineering.<br> While there, I was required to take a basic computer science course and
            discovered
            I liked computer science more than I knew. After a few years, I realized<br> I wasn't really interested in
            electrical
            engineering at all and I ended up dropping out. After a few years of not going to school and working as a
            tutor for
            math<br> and english at an educational network called Kumon, I decided I wanted to work on getting my degree to
            further my
            career. I discovered Make School via a<br> Reddit <abbr title="Ask Me Anything">AMA</abbr> and have since
            started my journey
            to hopefully becoming a software engineer here at Make School.</p>
